Project Reflection
Approach to Software Design
In designing software, I focus on balancing functionality and user experience, striving to create solutions that are both effective and user-friendly. This project strengthened my design skills, particularly in breaking down complex requirements into smaller, manageable tasks. By carefully considering each aspect of the design, from shape arrangement to texture application, I was able to create a visually engaging 3D scene. The design process I followed involved sketching the layout, choosing base shapes, and planning lighting and textures to achieve a polished final result. This approach to software design reinforced the importance of meticulous planning, a tactic I can carry forward to future projects.

Approach to Program Development
My approach to developing programs involves modular design and iterative testing. For this 3D scene, I employed new development strategies like layering textures and controlling lighting to create depth and realism. Iteration was crucial; each milestone built on the previous one, allowing me to refine the code and troubleshoot issues systematically. This iterative approach provided a pathway to improved results and highlighted the value of progressive enhancement. Throughout the project, my coding approach evolved to include more organized, modularized functions, which streamlined the development process and made it easier to troubleshoot and enhance individual elements.

Application of Computer Science to Personal Goals
Computer science, particularly computational graphics and visualizations, has provided me with skills that are highly relevant to my goals. This project gave me hands-on experience with computational graphics techniques, which I can leverage in both educational and professional contexts. Understanding the principles of 3D modeling, lighting, and texturing equips me with tools to explore more advanced graphics projects in my academic journey. Professionally, these skills are valuable in fields such as game design, simulation, and any industry requiring visual representation of data or concepts. This experience has reinforced my confidence in pursuing complex graphics projects, and Iâ€™m eager to apply these skills in future opportunities.
