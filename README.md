Project Summary and Reflection
The primary goal of the app I developed was to create a visually appealing 3D model, which was designed to replicate a cupcake with basic shapes in OpenGL. This app addresses the need to provide a simple but realistic 3D representation, potentially useful for clients looking to transform 2D concepts into 3D models. This functionality was aimed at users in fields such as design and 3D printing who require a visual concept of their ideas before creating physical objects.

To support this purpose, I focused on building screens that allowed the user to view the 3D model from different perspectives, providing both orthographic and perspective views. The UI is simple but effective, giving users control over camera navigation with keyboard and mouse inputs, ensuring the 3D model could be explored in detail. This design prioritizes user experience by keeping navigation intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to interact with the model with ease.

In coding the app, I used modular design strategies, creating individual functions for drawing shapes, applying textures, and managing camera navigation. These techniques not only streamlined development but also made testing easier. I tested the code by incrementally running and observing each feature, such as lighting and texture application, ensuring that each element functioned as expected. This testing process helped identify areas where adjustments were needed, ultimately revealing the importance of precise transformations and texture mapping for realistic visualization.

Throughout the project, I encountered challenges that required innovative solutions, particularly in handling texture projection and ensuring accurate lighting. I had to refine my understanding of OpenGLâ€™s shading and texturing methods, which enabled me to present the model in a polished form. The component of this project where I demonstrated my skills most effectively was in the realistic texture application on the 3D cupcake model. This task required precise mapping and lighting adjustments to achieve a cohesive appearance, which I believe shows my growing expertise in computer graphics development.
